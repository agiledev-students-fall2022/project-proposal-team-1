## Title: Save My Seat

### Project Description
It is a website that people can wait in line for a restaurant virtually. In New York City, it is sometimes frustrating to find a place to dine in since all the popular restaurants usually have  a long waiting line. It will be beneficial to both customers and restaurant owners if there is a software that automatically manages the waiting line so that people don't need to stay in line forever. 

This app will allow customers to stand in the online waiting line. (It can be accessed by either scanning the QR code displayed in front of a restaurant or directly using the app on tablets that will be installed in front of each restaurant.) The main page shows the current number of people in line and a button that directs users to get themselves in line. When the users click the button, they can enter their name and phone number to stand in line. They will be messaged with a URL where they can check how many people are in the front of the line and an option to cancel their spot. The users will be notified via message if it is their turn. If they are not present in 3 minutes, the turn will be passed to the next person.

### Users
People that don't want to stand in line for an hour to get into a restaurant.

### Functions
Main page - Display the number of people currently in line, button to direct users to enter themselves in line.
Waiting Line Form Page - Users enter their name and phone number to get in line.
User Page - Users will be able to check their turn in line real-time with messaged URL. They will also be notified if it is their turn to go in the restaurant. If they are not present in 3 minutes, the turn will be passed to the next person in line.

### Scope 
It seems feasible to develop this software within a semester.
